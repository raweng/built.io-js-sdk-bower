# About

This module is an SDK for [*Built.io Backend*](https://www.built.io/products/backend/overview) which is a backend-as-a-service provider. 

An *SDK*, or a software development kit, is like a gift box that comes with a set of software and other tools that are required to develop an application. 

This means that you can focus completely on client side development, and use the SDK to communicate with Built.io Backend effectively.
